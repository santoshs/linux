	depends on ARCH_SHMOBILE
	select HWSPINLOCK
	help
	  Say y here to support Renesas HPB bus semaphore functionality,
	  which gives one of CPU masters (that is, AP-System CPU in the Linux
	  system) an exclusive control of the modules connected to the Common
	  HPB bus.

	  This provides a synchronization mechanism for the various processor(s)
	  on the SoC.
